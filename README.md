# Gloomy Companion

This is a web-app for managing the monster ability decks in the board game [Gloomhaven](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven)

You can run it from the web directly on <https://johreh.github.io/gloomycompanion/>.

You can also download it and run it locally without internet connection. Click __Clone or download__ above, then __Download ZIP__. Unpack the ZIP and start the app by opening `index.html`.

If you want to add new cards, you need to update [`cards.js`](cards.js). The decks has the following syntax:

```json
{ name: "Name of monster"
, cards:
  [ [false, "42", "* First line", "** sub-line 1", "** sub-line 2", "* Second line"]
  , [true,  "55", "* Card text"]
  ]
}
```

The value in the first column is `true` if the deck shall be reshuffled after that card, `false` otherwise. The second colum is card initiative value. The following values is the card text, one row per column.

A single `*` means a top-level action. Double asterisk `**` means it modifies the previous action. Commonly used text snippets can be expanded using macros. E.g. `%move%` expands to the text _Move_ followed by the move icon, `%immobilize%` expands to _IMMOBILIZE_ followed by the immobilization icon. The list of available macros can be seen in [`macros.js`](macros.js).

## Development

* Clone the repository
* Run the [`gen-manifest.sh`](gen-manifest.sh) script (Linux and MacOS only; you'll have to make the `app.manifest` by hand if you are running Windows)

Any time a source/asset file is added or removed, re-run the above manifest generation script. Or manually make the appropriate change to the manifest instead.
